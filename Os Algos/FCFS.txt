FCFS scheduling algorithm-    

	To calculate the average waiting time using the FCFS algorithm first the waiting time of the first process is kept zero and the waiting time of the second process is the burst time of the first process and the waiting time of the third process is the sum of the burst times of the first and the second process and so on. After calculating all the waiting times the average waiting time is calculated as the average of all the waiting times. FCFS mainly says first come first serve the algorithm which came first will be served first.
Algorithm for FCFS scheduling:
Step 1: Start the process
Step 2: Accept the number of processes in the ready Queue
Step 3: For each process in the ready Q, assign the process id and accept the CPU burst time Step 4: Set the waiting of the first process as ‘0’ and its burst time as its turnaround time  Step 5: for each process in the Ready Q calculate
(a)	Waiting time for process(n)= waiting time of process (n-1) + Burst time of process(n-1)
(b)	Turnaround time for Process(n)= waiting time of Process(n)+ Burst time for process(n)
Step 6: Calculate (c) Average waiting time = Total waiting Time / Number of process
(d) Average Turnaround time = Total Turnaround Time / Number of process Step 7: Stop the process.



Program-

#include<stdio.h> 
#include<conio.h> 
void main() 
{ 
int 
bt[20], wt[20], tat[20], i, n; 
float wtavg, tatavg; 

printf("\nEnter the number of processes -- "); 
scanf("%d", &n); 
for(i=0;i<n;i++) 
{ 
printf("\nEnter Burst Time for Process %d -- ", i); 
scanf("%d", &bt[i]); 
} 
wt[0] = wtavg = 0; 
tat[0] = tatavg = bt[0]; 
for(i=1;i<n;i++) 
{ 
wt[i] = wt[i-1] +bt[i-1]; 
tat[i] = tat[i-1] +bt[i]; 
wtavg = wtavg + wt[i]; 
tatavg = tatavg + tat[i]; 
} 
printf("\t PROCESS \tBURST TIME \t WAITING TIME\t TURNAROUND TIME\n"); 
for(i=0;i<n;i++) 
printf("\n\t P%d \t\t %d \t\t %d\t\t%d", i, bt[i], wt[i], tat[i]); 
printf("\nAverage Waiting Time -- %f", wtavg/n); 
printf("\nAverage Turnaround Time -- %f", tatavg/n); 
getch();
